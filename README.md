Capturing of LoRa Signal
ðŸ“Œ To detect and capture the Lora Signals at different operating frequencies (433 MHz, 868 MHz, or 915 MHz) with different modulation schemes, we are planning to use the Spectrum sensing concept by SDR RF waveguru kit. 
ðŸ“ŒThe SDR USRP hardware consists of a baseband receiver that provides a capture function to capture baseband LoRa signal from the air. 
ðŸ“ŒThis baseband receiver is designed in such a way to receive, sample the captured data, and shift the spectrum to plot the complete frequency band together.
ðŸ“Œ SDR waveguru kit to Analyze the signal and Evaluation process go through the GNU radio Software.
ðŸ“Œ Inputs are given in the LoRa32 Module and Capturing of Signal is done through SDR and GNU radio.
